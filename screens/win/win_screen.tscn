government through regulations throwback humanity's progress, think about it, what could we have already achieved if there weren't these barriers?

what do some buriocrats have to do with others' properties? what give them the right to rule over you? have you even agreed with that?

i hope you get what is being threw back is not only our progress but also our freedom, of thinking, of choosing, of acting, of living.

remember that: as human beings we are free to choose our destiny as long as it doesn't threaten others.

be human, be free.
